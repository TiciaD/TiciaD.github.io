## Part 1: Web Development 101
### 8/23/2021 - 8/27/2021
Was the first week of bootcamp what I expected? Somehow the answer is both yes and no.
Yes in that I knew I'd be facing challenges and blockers since this is so new to me and I definitely have had some struggles getting things to work how I wanted.
But no in that I thought we'd jump right into programming languages, I didn't even think about the stuff you'd need to know beforehand!
Though to be fair, I didn't really know anything about the CLI and how to naivgate that with its various commands or about Github and its usefulness in collaborations but now I do and understand why we'd need a good grasp of these concepts before diving into any language.

I'm definitely excited to get into programming languages now to get some powerful tools in my belt. That way I can start designing my blog to look as cool as I'm picturing in my head! It's so interesting to browse through portfolio examples from past students or even just on Google seeing different professionals and their websites and knowing I'm just a few months of being capable of emulating that is such an exciting feeling. I have a little experience with the Adobe Creative Suite and Figma and I'm really excited to learn how to integrate that with my new programming capabilities.

I'd like my blog to showcase my education and career journey as well as projects that may personally interest me. Maybe even add links to articles and videos I've found helpful. The amount of things I'm learning everyday is overwhelming to say the least, but if I can show how I was able to overcome each obstacle maybe I could help someone else down the line. It's so amazing to see the awesome things my mentors' and peers' are able to put out everyday and they inspire me to be more awesome too!

One of my favorite shows has a very simple quote that says:
> It gets easier
> Everyday it gets a little easier
> But you gotta do it everyday
> That's the hard part

## Part 2: HTML and CSS headaches
### 8/30/2021 - 9/3/2021
Seeing all the possibilities of what I could potentially make and then trying to make that now with my limited toolset is pretty sobering. So maybe it's a bit forward and impatient of me to say I'd like to do everything but that's definitely not far from the truth. Some of the more specific things I'd most like to do are make my webpage more interactive. For instance, just making a menu button that opens up with options or making a picture pop out when you hover over it.

Me and CSS right now have a love hate relationship going on. After learning HTML and getting somewhat confident with that, CSS has been a headache in comparison. I can see the potential in CSS but I feel like my limited toolset is keeping me handcuffed from truly implementing its full potential. I've been doing some supplemental learning from YouTube tutorials on Website Building and they've been very informative and inspiring. It's just tough for me right now to bridge that gap between how they were able to implement those features in  their work and how to implement those same features in my own.

When I encounter problems in my code, I tend to keep a level head. First, I look around for the common mistakes like missing semicolons, quotes, parentheses, etc. When I eliminate that, if it's an issue I've encountered before or I may have heard someone else encountered, I'll go to whatever techniques I used then or check our class group chat and follow through what they were told to do. If that all fails, then Google is my new best friend, and I try to describe the problem and see if it's been posted on StackOverflow or other forums where someone else potentially had the same problem. I usually have to take a break after looking this far and long into a problem, so I step away from the computer to give myself a mental break whenever it gets to be too much. Eventually with enough time, patience and research I'm able to figure out what I was missing so I try to avoid asking for help in the class group chat as much as I can so I can develop my research abilities. It'll be important for me to know how to solve these problems on my own but also know when to ask help if it's too far above my abilities.

I feel like I'm learning so much every single day and yet still feel like I've barely dipped my toe in a sea of coding knowledge. I guess that means I'm only inches from the dreaded Cliff of Confusion... 

Mark me down as scared and excited! To quote my favorite musical:
> There's a million things I haven't done but just you *wait*...

## Part 3: All Aboard the JavaScript Struggle Train
### 9/6/21 - 9/10/21
Well I may have predicted my struggle this week but I didn't expect it to be this bad. After a busy labor day weekend celebrating my mom's birthday, I didn't have much time to get started or get ahead on the coursework for the week. Maybe that was my first sign that I was in for a rough week but I definitely knew once I got to the Grasshopper modules for the Sprint. The Intro to Interviewing module was absolutely brutal compared to some of the more guided modules that 'held your hand' with the new concepts. It took me several days to finish that one since I kept taking breaks every time I got frustrated, which was a lot... 

I went ahead and started on the Build projects, the Silly Story generator was pretty straightforward and I didn't have many problems with it, but the Alarm Clock? I learned how to fail pretty quick with that one. In hindsight, I realize I probably should've used more pseudocode to make a plan of attack on how to approach the Alarm clock project. I guess it was slightly jarring to go from the guided instructions for the Silly Story generator that had about 70% of the work done for you. To then go to the Alarm clock project that had no real instructions and just a few basic requirements listed. I felt so overwhelmed because I didn't really know where to start. Again I think I would've benefitted from more pseudocode knowledge on how to approach a problem and plan out what you need and what variables and functions would help you accomplish that. Especially since I didn't feel like I learned a lot from Grasshopper since I often stumbled into the right answer rather than understood *why* it was right. 

Demo day was pretty embarassing, I barely had a working digital clock that I spent 24hrs trying to figure out how to start on, let alone getting the alarm part working. Not to mention how advanced some of my other classmates' code looked! All I could think the whole time was, 'How on Earth did you figure out how to do that? AND still have time to meet several stretch goals?!' I don't like failing but my instructors have been drilling it into our heads every week that we're going to fail, we're going to fail a lot, and that the real key is learning to fail fast so you can move on and learn from it. I had Friday after Demo to be slightly upset about it and take a break from it but I've been hitting the books and tutorials hard this weekend to recover and hopefully learn from the mistakes I made in this last project so that I can avoid making them in the future. Let's just say I've had a **LOT** of JavaScript practice and many hours of pseudocode crunching to prepare for this week.

For the questions: I think HTML, CSS and JavScript all have their own place in web development. HTML does a good job of giving a baseline structure and skeleton for the webpage. CSS is surprisingly complex and can add a lot of style and design to a website on its own without even having to use web design softwares. JavaScript is the real life of the webpage though, once you master it you can bring a lot of personality to a static webpage. Curently my blog doesn't have any objects, I'm kind of waiting until we get to some frameworks to make it easier to add the things I want to my website. As for pseudocoding, I didn't know much about it this week but after the struggles I had with planning the alarm clock project, I'm going to be practicing it a lot over the weekend so I'm better prepared for the next Build.

## Part 4: Pseudocode and Coming to Terms with the Chaos
### 9/13/2021 - 9/17/2021
Started off the week learning about pseudocode and doing a little project for it, where we took an everyday activity or common process and pseudocoded it. I chose to pseudocode an elevator and I ennjoyed doing that a lot more than I did just diving into the Alarm Clock project! Being able to think the whole thing through really helped me organize it and come up with a better idea of how I would code. All I'm missing is the JavaScript fluency to be able to translate all this pseudocode to actual code. Since the Pseudocode project went well though, I've come to terms with the chaos of JavaScript. I understand I'm not going to have to do anything extravagant, it's more important to be able to look at the final code and be able to explain *how* it works for the most part. I still feel like I have a long way to go, but I'm a lot less anxious about not fully comprehending JavaScript yet.

During Onboarding I found a lot of the resources given to me super helpful. I like having multiple explanations of the same concept, especially some that are a little more complex. I just wished we had more lectures over some of the basics. I felt like there was a lot of reading the MDN and other articles and books but I personally feel like I learn better with actual lectures where I can actively see these concepts explained and applied. I did a lot of outside learning, specifically with Udemy watching video lectures from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp. He does a great job explaining JavaScript from scratch for total beginners, literally describing each concept in-depth like variables, for...of loops, while loops, functions, etc. They were super helpful, I feel like understanding these basics more in-depth helped me with my problem-solving since I now actually understand what these methods can do a lot better.
